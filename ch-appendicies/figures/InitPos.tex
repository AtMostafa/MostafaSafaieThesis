    \caption[Initial position evolution]
    {\textbf{Initial position distributions for correct and error trials diverged progressively during training.}
    Similar to \autoref{fig-ctrlTrd}e, each panel shows PDF of the initial position of the animals for correct (green) and incorrect (red) trials, but plotted separately for each training session~(\#1 to~\#30).
    Dashed lines represent cumulative distribution functions~(right y-axis).
    For each PDF, $\sigma$ values denote the standard deviation.
    Each PDF included pooled data from all the animals trained in the control condition ($n=54$).
