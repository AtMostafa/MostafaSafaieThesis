		{\textbf{Dorsal striatum lesions induced a transient increase in the percentage of trials during which animals remained close to the reward area.}
		\textit{Upper left}: Session-by-session percentage of trials in which animals remained close to the reward area (Frontal trials).
		Group data for animals with DLS, DMS and DS lesion.
		\textit{Lower left}: Same as above, but for the illustrative animals, shown in \Autoref{fig:lesion:task}{T-F}.
		\textit{Right}: Statistical comparisons before and after striatal lesion.
		Same color code for individual lesion type as in \autoref{fig:lesion:task}.
