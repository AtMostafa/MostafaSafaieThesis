		\textbf{a)}
		Same as \autoref{fig:time:CtrlTrd}, panel~c,~right, but the animals were divided in two groups according to whether they performed the front-back-front trajectory (gray) or not (other, orange).
		\textbf{b)}
		Entrance times.
		$p=0.0066$ (permutation test).
		\textbf{c)}
		SD of ET.
		$p=0.03$ (permutation test).
		\textbf{d)}
		Percentage of correct trials.
		$p=0.01$ (permutation test).
		For panels~b--d, same color code as in panel~a.
		Data from sessions~\#~$\geq20$ were averaged for each animal.
