		\textit{Left}: Entrance time across learning sessions.
		\textit{Middle}: Session-by-session standard deviation of ET.
		\textit{Right}: Percentage of trials during which animals used the run-and-wait (reverse) routine.
		Time course of learning the reverse treadmill task is similar to that of the normal treadmill task.
