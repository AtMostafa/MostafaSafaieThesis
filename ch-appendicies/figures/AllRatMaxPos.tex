    \caption[Group Max.\ Pos.\ Comparison]
    {\textbf{Comparing the maximum position of animals for the entire dataset.}
    Each boxplot represents the range of the Max.\ Pos.\ (center line, median; box, 25th and 75th percentiles; whiskers, 5th and 95th percentiles) for control and lesioned (before and after training) animals.
    For each animal, the median value of their average trajectory was computed over the last 5 sessions performed without lesion (\textit{Control} group, at least 30 training sessions), or the last 5 sessions performed after striatal lesion (\textit{Lesion} group).
    Comparison using the permutation test (10000 permutations).
