    \caption[Group Max.\ Pos.\ Comparison]
    {\textbf{Comparing the maximum position for the entire dataset.}
    Each boxplot represents the range of the Max.\ Pos.\ (center line, median; box, 25th and 75th percentiles; whiskers, 5th and 95th percentiles) across a group of animals.
    For every animal, the median value of the last 5 sessions in the control condition (\textit{Control}), or after the striatal lesion (\textit{Lesion}) was considered.
    The lesion group includes every lesioned animal, regardless of lesion location (DLS, DMS, DS) and lesion type (early lesion, late lesion).
    Comparison using the permutation test (10000 permutations).
