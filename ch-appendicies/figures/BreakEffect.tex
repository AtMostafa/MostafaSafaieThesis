    {\textbf{Impact of two week of break in practice on performance.}
    \textbf{(A-C)} Task performance before and after a 2-week break. Animals were trained for at least 30 sessions before the 2-week break. (A), Entrance time. (B) Percentage of trials during which animal used the wait-and-run routine. (C) Speed of the animals when they ran toward the reward area. A small but significant reduction in running speed was observed just after the break ($\delta$ denotes the effect size).
