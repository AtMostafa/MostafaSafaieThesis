		{\textbf{Impact of a two weeks break in practice on performance.}
		\textbf{A-C)} Task performance before and after a two weeks-long break in practice.
		Non-lesioned animals had stable performance before the two weeks-long break (same duration than lesion recovery period) in practice.
		\textbf{A)} Entrance time.
		\textbf{B)} Percentage of trials during which animals used the wait-and-run routine.
		\textbf{C)} Speed of the animals when they ran toward the reward area.
		A small but significant reduction in running speed was observed just after the break ($\delta$ denotes the effect size).
