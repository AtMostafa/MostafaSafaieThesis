		{\textbf{Impact of two weeks of break on performance.}
		Task performance before and after a two week-long break in practice.
		Non-lesioned animals had stable performance before the two week-long break (same duration than lesion recovery period) in practice (\textit{A}: ET; \textit{B}: percentage of trials during which animals used the wait-and-run routine; \textit{C}: speed of the animals when they ran toward the reward area).
		A small but significant reduction in running speed was observed just after the break ($\delta$ denotes the effect size) that was restored after a few more training sessions.
