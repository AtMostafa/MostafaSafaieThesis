It is time to discuss some of the downsides of my thesis project, some possible flaws that might result in interpretational limitations.
First issue relates to the structure of the task.
The treadmill task does not require a clear and distinct operant response, rather the animal crosses the infrared beam, the location of which is unmarked and unknown to the animal.
This is uncharacteristic for a time-estimation task.
In retrospect, had we installed a simple lever or nose-poke above the reward port to register the entrance times, it would have provided a more straightforward timing task.
The task was originally designed to be used at faster speeds (30~cm/s) and such a mechanism was perhaps deemed impractical.
%======
Next point is also with regards to the task.
In its nature, I think, the treadmill task favors a motor strategy, and this might have biased our results.
Aside from the immobile condition, the treadmill always moves and so imposes a dynamic environment to the agent, an environment in which avoiding motor activity is not even possible, since eventually the animal would arrive to the back wall and \textit{has to} move.
The immobile condition was an attempt to remedy this problem.
Indeed, we showed that better performance was correlated with more movement along the treadmill and visually, I observed that our best-performing animal developed an stereotyped ritual in interaction with the back wall of the treadmill.
However, even in this condition, animals couldn't simply stay in the reward area, and presumably \textit{estimate} the goal time duration, at least they had to move a few centimeters backward to prevent premature interruption of the beam.
Ideally, to test the embodied view, the time-estimation task should not allow any motor activity, perhaps by penalizing movements however, a new problem arises:
what would be the ecological relevance of such a task, especially in suprasecond timescale?
And this is closely linked to my last remark.
Even though learning about embodiment and its implications immensely influenced my thinking, I fear that in the context of timing, it might be unfalsifiable.
For instance, even if human subjects are asked to not move at all during a time-estimation task, and they perfectly follow the protocol, one could argue (and I do argue) that they still mentally picture a motor activity or a moving object.
Overall, I think the best argument in favor of embodied time-estimation is its parsimony, and that adopting this perspective affords a great explanatory power.
\par
The lesion experiments are also not flawless.
One issue is that the quantity of reward progressively decreased for correct trials with later entrance times (\autoref{fig:methods:taskRules}).
Thus, had lesioned animals started running at a position similar to normal rats using a slower speed, they would have received a slightly smaller drop of reward.
The most skeptical reader might suggest that this is the reason why animals tend to wait less, to avoid smaller rewards.
However, the reward magnitude drops at a low rate, therefore I do not think a $\sim$5\% smaller reward is noticeable.
In any case, at least for the lesion experiments, a constant reward size after the goal time would have been preferred.
%======
Another issue that might have downgraded our effect sizes, especially with regards to the maximum position analysis, was the behavioral variability.
Some animals developed different strategies to solve the task (\autoref{fig:appendix:BadCtrl}).
At the time, to respect the natural variability of behavior, we indiscriminately carried on with the lesion experiments for all the animals.
Later on, while processing the data, I realized most outlier data points belonged to animals with strange pre-lesion behavior, but at this stage we did not have any excuse to exclude those animals, and we did not.
Instead, we explicitly set criteria for including animals, for instance in the maximum position analysis (\autoref{fig:lesion:maxPos}).
These criteria might seem arbitrary to some, although they serve the purpose of the analysis and were set blind to the performance of individual animals.
I suppose performing the lesion only in animals that behaviorally conformed to the wait-and-run routine would have rid us of much of the \textit{extra} variability and would have been also justified.

Still, why animals and humans seem to favor embodied and interactive timing strategies over purely internal mechanisms is not clear.
Insights regarding this question might be obtained by considering adaptive behavior in an evolutionary perspective\cite{Cisek2019} and time in the context of ecologically valid timing tasks\cite{vanRijn2018}.


Future work should further investigate how to mathematically capture the algorithms underlying temporally-constrained actions and decisions and the possible contribution of the striatum to processing multimodal (sensorimotor, cognitive, emotional) contextual information together with dopamine-mediated feedback and motivational signals.


Future studies should investigate whether signaling effort and urgency are the two sides of a unique function implemented in the \gls{bg} to maximize the reward rate while minimizing costs.
