Still, why animals and humans seem to favor embodied and interactive timing strategies over purely internal mechanisms is not clear.
Insights regarding this question might be obtained by considering adaptive behavior in an evolutionary perspective\cite{Cisek2019} and time in the context of ecologically valid timing tasks\cite{vanRijn2018}.


Future work should further investigate how to mathematically capture the algorithms underlying temporally-constrained actions and decisions and the possible contribution of the striatum to processing multimodal (sensorimotor, cognitive, emotional) contextual information together with dopamine-mediated feedback and motivational signals.
