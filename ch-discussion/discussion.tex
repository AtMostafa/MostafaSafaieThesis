\chapter{Discussion}
\label{ch:discussion}
In this chapter, for each set of experiments, I first summarize the results and discuss their more general implications.
Then, I present a short conclusion of the entire work, attempting to reconcile all the ideas.
Next, I will describe some points that I think might have imposed limitations on the interpretation of this work.
Finally, some ideas and directions for my future-self are presented that can complement and strengthen this manuscript.
