\chapter{Discussion}
\label{ch:discussion}
In this chapter, for each set of experiments, I will first summarize the results, and then discuss their more general implications.
Then I present a short conclusion of the entire work, trying to reconcile all the ideas.
Next, I will describe some of the weak points from which I think this work might be suffering.
Finally, some ideas and directions for my future-self are presented that can complement and strengthen this manuscript.
