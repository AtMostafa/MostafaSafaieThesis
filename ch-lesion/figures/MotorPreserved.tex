		{\textbf{Preserved spontaneous locomotor activity and modulation of running speed following striatal lesion.}
		\textbf{A)} Distance ran while exploring a new (and immobile) treadmill for non-lesioned (control) and lesioned rats ($n=12$, same color code for individual lesion type as in \autoref{fig:lesion:task}).
		\textbf{B)} Average running speed in a free running task (no reward) in which control and lesioned rats were submitted to trials with incremental treadmill speed (same color code as in panel~A).
		Golden lines indicate significant differences between groups (corrected for multiple comparisons).
		\textbf{C)} Trials were split into 2 categories depending on whether rats initiated their run from the middle or back portion of the treadmill.
		Speed was computed and averaged across trial type.
		\textbf{D)} Speed of the runs initiated from either the middle or back portion of the treadmill, and calculated for each animal over the last 5 sessions before lesion (\textit{left}) and the last 5 stable sessions after lesion (\textit{right}).
