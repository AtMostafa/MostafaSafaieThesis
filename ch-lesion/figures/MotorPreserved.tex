	{\textbf{Preserved spontaneous locomotor activity and modulation of running speed following striatal lesion.}
	\textbf{(A)} Distance ran while exploring a new immobile treadmill for non-lesioned and lesioned rats ($n=12$ each group).
	\textbf{(B)} Average running speed in a free running task (no reward) in which control and lesioned rats were submitted to trials with incremental treadmill speed (same color code as in panel ~A).
	\textbf{(C)} Average speed when rats ran toward the reward area.
	Data were split according to the position of the rats on the treadmill when initiating their runs.
	\textbf{(D)} Speed of runs initiated either in the back or the middle portion of the treadmill calculated for each animal on the last 5 sessions before lesion (left) and sessions \#4 to \#9 after lesion (right).
