        \textbf{A)}
        Trial-by-trial licking pattern (\textit{top}) and averaged lick rate aligned to intertrial onset for a single animal in 3~sessions (1~just before and 2~after lesion).
        Each tick shows one lick in the reward delivery port.
        \textbf{B-D)}
        Effect of striatal lesion on lick onset delay (\textit{B}), number of licks per intertrial (\textit{C}) and peak licking frequency (\textit{D}).
        Same color code for individual lesion type as in \autoref{fig:lesion:task}.
