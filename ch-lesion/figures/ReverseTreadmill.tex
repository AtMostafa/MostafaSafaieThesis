		{\textbf{Preserved performance of a run-and-wait routine following striatal lesion.}
		\textbf{A)} Trajectory of a proficient animal trained in a version of the timing task in which the belt moved toward the reward area (rather than away from it).
		9 consecutive trials (shaded areas) and intertrials (white areas) are shown.
		\textbf{B)} Trajectories from a single representative animal in two sessions before and two sessions after lesion.
		\textbf{C-D)} Comparison of ET (\textbf{C}) and percentage of run-and-wait (reverse) routine usage (\textbf{D}), before and after striatal lesion.
