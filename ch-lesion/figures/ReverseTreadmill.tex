	\textbf{(A)} Trajectory of a proficient animal trained in a version of the timing task in which the belt moved toward the reward area (rather than away from it). 9 consecutive trials and intertrials are shown.
	\textbf{(B)} Trajectories from a single representative animal in two sessions before and two sessions after lesion.
	\textbf{(C-D)} Comparison of ET (C) and percentage of run-and-wait routine usage (D), before and after striatal lesion.
