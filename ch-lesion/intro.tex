\chapter{Lesion Experiments} \label{ch:lesion}
In the last chapter, I presented many experiments, all in support of the hypothesis that time estimation is embodied and that accurate timing requires stereotyped interaction with the environment.
Stereotyped interactions appear as motor routines to the external observer.
Thus, the question of how the brain measures the elapsed time is translated to how the brain generates or controls motor routines.
