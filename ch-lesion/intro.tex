\chapter{Lesion Experiments} \label{ch:lesion}
In the last chapter, I presented many experiments, all in support of the hypothesis that time estimation is embodied and that accurate timing requires stereotyped interaction with the environment.
Stereotyped interactions appear as motor routines to the external observer.
Thus, the question of how the brain measures the elapsed time is translated to how the brain generates or controls motor routines.
In this study, we focused on the dorsal striatum, the main input nuclei of the \gls{bg}, since its motor-related functions are long-reported and well-known.
We took advantage of the motor routine developed by the animals in the treadmill task, i.e., the wait-and-run motor routine (\Autoref{fig:time:CtrlTrd}{d}) to investigate the role of the striatum in performing and controlling kinematics of motor routines.
