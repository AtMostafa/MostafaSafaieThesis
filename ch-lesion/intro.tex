\chapter{Striatum and Effort} \label{ch:lesion}
In the last chapter, I presented many experiments, all in support of the hypothesis that time estimation is embodied and that accurate timing requires stereotyped interaction with the environment.
Stereotyped interactions appear as motor routines to the external observer, e.g., the superstitious behavior of pigeons (\autoref{ch:intro:EmbodiedClock}) and the wait-and-run routine of rats (\autoref{ch:time}).
Thus, the question of how the brain measures the elapsed time is translated to how the brain generates or controls motor routines.
In this study, we focused on the striatum, the main input nuclei of the \gls{bg}, since its motor-related functions are long-reported, well-known, and still debated.\footnotemark\
We took advantage of the motor routine developed by the animals in the treadmill task, i.e., the wait-and-run motor routine (\Autoref{fig:time:CtrlTrd}{d}) to investigate the role of the striatum in performing and controlling the kinematics of motor routines.
