We trained Long-Evans rats (including those illustrated in \autoref{fig:time:CtrlTrd}) in the treadmill task (\autoref{ch:methods:normalTrdTask}) for at least 30 sessions.
Once they reached a stable behavioral performance, 

In this task, to obtain a drop of sucrose solution, rats had to wait for a fixed goal time (GT: 7~s relative to treadmill onset) before entering a reward area located at the front of the treadmill, while its belt was slowly moving backward (Fig. 1A).
Across practice sessions composed of $\sim$120~trials, animals waited longer and longer to enter the reward area close to the GT (Fig. 1B, fig. S1).
Task proficiency was clearly associated with the acquisition and reliable performance of the following routine: 1) during the inter-trial, following the consumption of sweetened water, rats remained in the reward area; 2) when the treadmill was turned on (trial onset), they did nothing and let the moving belt carry them away from the reward area; 3) when they reached the rear wall of the treadmill, they started running at a speed faster than the treadmill to re-enter the reward area just after 7~s (Entrance Time, $ET>GT$).
After 2-3 weeks of daily practice, rats used this wait-and-run routine in about 75\% of the trials (Fig. 1C, see methods for the operational definition of this routine).
Finally, learning this routine was paralleled by a robust invigoration of the running phase toward the reward area (Fig. 1D). 
\par
Regarding the aforementioned issue of performance confound, a key feature of this routine is that its first half requires the animals to follow a specific procedure (staying in the reward area after licking the reward, remaining still after treadmill onset until reaching the rear wall) without producing movements. 
Thus, a deficit in performing this routine can only be attributed to altered processes upstream of motor implementation.
In addition, because we used a motorized treadmill, animals were forced to run, at least once they reached the rear wall.
Thus, for the rats, both disengaging from the task (not approaching the reward area during the entire duration of a trial) and incorrect response ($ET<GT$) were associated with expending a significant amount of energy to run (for nothing), a condition that rarely occurred in tasks previously used to probe striatal contribution to the control of purposive actions.
We then performed fiber-sparing lesions of the dS in animals (n = 57) well-trained in this task.
The lesions targeted either the dorsolateral or the dorsomedial region of the striatum or both territories (DLS, DMS, DS lesions, Fig. 1, E to G, fig. S2). 
Behavioral testing resumed two weeks after the lesion surgery (fig. S3).
The averaged ET of animals with the largest lesions (mostly DS lesions) dropped during the first post-lesion sessions (Fig. 1, F to H).
These animals ran toward the reward area prematurely at trial onset (Fig. 1, F, G, and H) and, consequently, a reduction in the usage of the wait-and-run routine was observed during this first post-lesion session (Fig. 1, F, G and I).
But surprisingly, most of these animals recovered from this initial impairment and after a few additional sessions, task proficiency was similar to the pre-lesion level (Fig. 1, H and I).
Moreover, for most of the animals with a lesion restricted to the DLS and DMS, task proficiency was virtually unaltered when resuming behavioral testing (Fig.1, E, H and I).
In contrast, the animals' speed when they ran toward the reward area was irreversibly decreased following lesion (Fig. 1, E to G and J), an effect that robustly correlated with lesion size (fig. S4).
Noticeably, the maintained task proficiency following dS lesion suggested that the motivation of the animals to perform the task and to obtain rewards was preserved. 
In agreement with this, animals with a  dS lesion kept licking the sweetened water upon correct ET, although licking initiation was delayed (fig. S5).
\par
These results suggest that the dS is selectively critical for the invigoration of the reward-oriented active component of the wait-and-run routine.
But at this stage, we can not rule out that the transient impairment in performance induced by large dS lesions reflects a deterioration of procedural learning and a reversal to the behavior expressed before routine acquisition (Fig. 1B and C, \cite{Dhawale2019}), compensated in subsequent post-lesion sessions through a dS-independent learning process.
We thus trained a new group of animals in a modified version of the task in which the treadmill belt moved slowly toward the reward area (instead of away from it).
Several animals learned to perform proficiently this version of the task by adopting a run-and-wait routine: they moved to the back of the treadmill during intertrial (after licking the sweetened water from the previous trial and while the belt was immobile) and, following trial onset, they remained immobile while being passively transported toward the reward area (Fig. 2, A to C).
Consequently, after extensive training, animals were positioned away from the reward area at trial onset in a bigger fraction of the trials (Fig. 2, A and D). 
If the dS lesion abolished this procedural learning, we expected animals to start the trials close to the reward area in the first post-lesion session. 
This is not what was observed and, more generally, performance of the run-and-wait routine was spared by dS lesion , Fig. 2, B to D).
A lack of effect of the dS lesion could be due to the fact that learning the run-and-wait routine was easier than learning the wait-and-run routine. 
This is unlikely to be the case as learning to conform to the GT constraint using the run-and-wait routine took a similar number of sessions compared to the wait-and-run routine (fig. S6).
\par
Altogether, these results indicate that the dS is not required to initiate or execute the sequential steps of a learned motor routine but is critical to invigorate its reward-oriented running phase.
To better understand the origin of this vigor deficit, we examined whether the striatal lesions affected the animals' elementary ability to modulate their running speed.
It has been previously shown that the speed of reward-oriented movements increases with movement distance to minimize temporal discounting of rewards \cite{Shadmehr2010JN, Reppert2018JNPhys}.
We compared running speed in trials during which running epochs were initiated from the back versus the middle of the treadmill (Fig. 3A, i.e., long vs short run distance).
As predicted, animals ran faster when they initiated their runs from the back of the treadmill than from its middle (Fig. 3B). This modulation was maintained after dS lesion (Fig. 3B), although running speeds were generally slower following dS lesion.
Next, we compared basic locomotor activity between control and lesioned rats, in a paradigm that did not include reward-oriented runs, using a different treadmill.
The locomotion test consisted of several trials (30~s long) at fixed speeds (0~cm/s to 40~cm/s), interleaved with short breaks (30~s long).
We found that both control and lesioned rats displayed similar exploratory locomotor activity when the treadmill remained immobile (Fig. 3C).
In addition, in trials in which the treadmill was turned on, both groups were similarly able to follow a reasonable range of imposed speeds even though, as the speed increased, animals with a dS lesion ran with slightly slower speeds than control animals (Fig. 3D).
Altogether, this set of experiments indicated that the dS lesion spared the ability of rats to modulate their running speed.
\par
If the dS lesion spared the rats' ability to modulate their running speed, the most parsimonious explanation of our results is that lesioned animals "preferred" slower speeds.
A similar conclusion had been reached when studying the origin of bradykinesia in PD, which led to the proposal that such reluctance to perform fast movements was caused by an increased sensitivity to movement cost (or effort) \cite{Mazzoni2007JN, Baraduc2013JN}.
Could a similar interpretation apply to our results?
To address this question, we took advantage of the optimal control framework that relies on the assumption that animal behavior is optimal with respect to a cost function.
We implemented a simple model to simulate the optimal trajectory of a rat taking into account costs related to locomotion control (effort) and those imposed by the task rules (running in the front is costly as this leads to premature ET, which is penalized).
Two approximations of effort- and task rules-related costs were combined in 4 versions of the models and we found that increasing effort sensitivity consistently resulted in optimal trajectories that were closer to the reward area, hence the combination of late initiation of the run phase with fast speeds not used (Fig. 4A).
This result is not only in agreement with the reduced running speed observed following lesion but is also reminiscent of the behavior observed during the very first post-lesion sessions, when animals with large dS lesion ran mainly close to the reward area (Fig 1, F and G). 
We thus reanalyzed the effect of dS lesion on the trajectory, focusing on animals with a significant reduction in running speed (Fig. 4B, i.e., animals with larger lesion) and on trials during which animals perfectly executed the wait-and-run routine.
Following dS lesion, rats started running forward earlier relative the length of the treadmill (Fig. 4C).
This effect, while being maximal on the first post-lesion sessions, remained significant after three weeks of daily testing (Fig. 4D) and was correlated with lesion size (Fig. 4E).
