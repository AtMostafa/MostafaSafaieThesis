To obtain a drop of sweetened water, rats had to wait for a fixed \gls{gt} of 7~s from trial onset before entering the reward area located at the front of the treadmill, while the belt was slowly moving backward (\Autoref{fig:lesion:task}{A}).
Across training sessions composed of $\sim$120~trials, animals learned to wait longer and longer to enter the reward are just after the \gls{gt} and achieve higher percentage of correct trials (\Autoref{fig:lesion:task}{B}, and \autoref{fig:appendix:CorrectTrialCurve}).
Task proficiency was clearly associated with the acquisition and reliable performance of the following routine (\Autoref{fig:lesion:task}{C}):
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item during the intertrial, following the consumption of the reward, rats remained in the reward area;
    \item when the treadmill was turned on (trial onset), they did not move and let the belt carry them away from the reward area;
    \item when they reached the rear wall of the treadmill, they started outrunning the treadmill to reenter the reward area, i.e., the \gls{et} just after 7~s ($ET\geq GT$).
\end{enumerate}
After 2--3 weeks of daily practice, rats used this wait-and-run routine in about 75\% of the trials (\Autoref{fig:lesion:task}{C}, see \autoref{ch:methods:dataAnalysis} for the operational definition of this routine).
Finally, learning this routine was paralleled by a robust invigoration of the running phase of the motor routine toward the reward area (\Autoref{fig:lesion:task}{D}).

\par
Once the performance was stable, after at least 30 training sessions, we performed fiber-sparing lesions of the striatum ($n=57$ animals, for the lesion protocol, see \autoref{ch:method:lesion}).
The lesions targeted either the \gls{dls} or the \gls{dms}, or both territories, the entire \gls{ds} (\Autoref{fig:lesion:task}{E-G}, see also \autoref{fig:method:LesionSizeLocation}).
Behavioral testing resumed two weeks after the lesion surgery.
Visually, the animals had normal behavior (locomotion, food/water intake) in their homecage at the end of the recovery period.
\par
After the lesion, the behavior of the animals could be divided into an `acute' phase in the first few sessions post-lesion, and a `stable' phase that begins $\sim$9 sessions after the lesion and persists.
This dichotomy does not apply to every animal, apparently animals with bigger lesions have a stronger acute effect.
This can be seen in example animals of \Autoref{fig:lesion:task}{F,~G}, and at the population level in \Autoref{fig:lesion:task}{H}, however, the case illustrated in \Autoref{fig:lesion:task}{E} is an example of a rat with smaller lesion and no acute condition.
To better visualize the acute effect, I grouped the first two post-lesion sessions and presented their average statistics throughout this manuscript.
Similarly, sessions $+9$ and $+10$ were also grouped to represent the stable effect of the lesion.
Animals with this acute effect ran toward the reward area prematurely after trial onset and, consequently, a drop in the usage of the wait-and-run routine was observed during these first post-lesion sessions (\Autoref{fig:lesion:task}{I}).
Surprisingly, most of these animals recovered from this initial impairment and after a few additional sessions, task proficiency was similar to the pre-lesion level (\Autoref{fig:lesion:task}{H-I}, right panels, compare the stable condition to the `before' condition).
Moreover, for most of the animals with a lesion restricted to the DLS and DMS, task proficiency was virtually unaltered when resuming behavioral testing.
We then looked at animals' speed, the velocity with which they outran the opposing treadmill in the third step of the wait-and-run motor routine (see \autoref{ch:methods:dataAnalysis} for the definition).
Strikingly, the animals' speed was irreversibly reduced following striatal lesion (\Autoref{fig:lesion:task}{I}).
In addition, the difference in speed due to lesion was strongly correlated with the size of the lesion (\Autoref{fig:appendix:spd}{A}).
\input{ch-lesion/figures/Lick.tex}
Moreover, the maintained task proficiency following striatal lesion suggested that the motivation of the animals to perform the task and to obtain rewards was preserved.
In agreement with this statement, animals with a striatal lesion kept licking the reward after committing correct trials(\Autoref{fig:lesion:lick}{A}).
They licked the number of times after reward delivery and also their peak lick frequency was not affected (\Autoref{fig:lesion:lick}{C-D}).
However, they systematically started to lick later (\Autoref{fig:lesion:lick}{B}).
Much like the speed, this effect was also irreversible, and might be a measure of slower speed in approaching the reward port after crossing the infrared beam (which is $\sim$10~cm from the reward port), or slower postural adjustments to consume the delivered reward.
Thus far, these results suggest that the striatum is selectively critical for the invigoration of the reward-oriented active component of the wait-and-run routine.

What was the reason for the acute effect right after the break?
At this stage, we can not rule out that the transient impairment in performance induced by large striatal lesions reflects deterioration of the motor routine and reversal to the behavior expressed before routine acquisition, i.e., staying in the front, possibly to get the reward (see \Autoref{fig:time:CtrlTrd}{e} and \autoref{fig:appendix:initPos}).
This impairment then could have been compensated in subsequent post-lesion sessions through a striatum-independent learning process.
To test this hypothesis we modified the task such that the treadmill belt moved slowly toward the reward area, instead of away from it.
This configuration, hereafter called the `reverse' treadmill, allows the animals to locomote to the back of the treadmill during the intertrial while the treadmill is not moving, stay still upon trial onset and be passively transported to the reward port at the right time ($ET>GT$).
Such a ``run-and-wait'' motor routine is qualitatively comparable to the original run-and-wait routine, and critically, initiates in the back of the treadmill, hence we can dissociate routine initiation from reversal to the behavior expressed before routine acquisition.
Another group of animals were trained in this version of the task and learned to proficiently perform the task by adopting the run-and-wait routine described above (\Autoref{fig:lesion:rev}{A}).
That is, after extensive training, animals were in the back of the treadmill at trial onset in a bigger fraction of the trials. 
If the striatal lesion abolished the ability to perform this motor routine, we expect animals to start the trials close to the reward area, at least in the first post-lesion sessions.
On the contrary, the performance of the run-and-wait routine was spared by striatal lesions (\Autoref{fig:lesion:rev}{C-D}).
Lack of effect of the striatal lesion on the performance of the motor routine could be due to the fact that learning the reverse treadmill task was easier than the normal treadmill task, thus the relearning procedure might have happened during the very first session after the lesion.
This is unlikely to be the case since initial learning of the reverse treadmill task took a similar learning curve compared to that of the normal treadmill task (\autoref{fig:appendix:revLearn}).

Altogether, these results indicate that the dS is not required to initiate or execute the sequential steps of a learned motor routine but is critical to invigorate its reward-oriented running phase.
To better understand the origin of this vigor deficit, we examined whether the striatal lesions affected the animals' elementary ability to modulate their running speed.
It has been previously shown that the speed of reward-oriented movements increases with movement distance to minimize temporal discounting of rewards \cite{Shadmehr2010JN, Reppert2018JNPhys}.
We compared running speed in trials during which running epochs were initiated from the back versus the middle of the treadmill (Fig. 3A, i.e., long vs short run distance).
As predicted, animals ran faster when they initiated their runs from the back of the treadmill than from its middle (Fig. 3B). This modulation was maintained after dS lesion (Fig. 3B), although running speeds were generally slower following dS lesion.
Next, we compared basic locomotor activity between control and lesioned rats, in a paradigm that did not include reward-oriented runs, using a different treadmill.
The locomotion test consisted of several trials (30~s long) at fixed speeds (0~cm/s to 40~cm/s), interleaved with short breaks (30~s long).
We found that both control and lesioned rats displayed similar exploratory locomotor activity when the treadmill remained immobile (Fig. 3C).
In addition, in trials in which the treadmill was turned on, both groups were similarly able to follow a reasonable range of imposed speeds even though, as the speed increased, animals with a dS lesion ran with slightly slower speeds than control animals (Fig. 3D).
Altogether, this set of experiments indicated that the dS lesion spared the ability of rats to modulate their running speed.







Regarding the aforementioned issue of performance confound, a key feature of this routine is that its first half requires the animals to follow a specific procedure (staying in the reward area after licking the reward, remaining still after treadmill onset until reaching the rear wall) without producing movements. 
Thus, a deficit in performing this routine can only be attributed to altered processes upstream of motor implementation.
In addition, because we used a motorized treadmill, animals were forced to run, at least once they reached the rear wall.
Thus, for the rats, both disengaging from the task (not approaching the reward area during the entire duration of a trial) and incorrect response ($ET<GT$) were associated with expending a significant amount of energy to run (for nothing), a condition that rarely occurred in tasks previously used to probe striatal contribution to the control of purposive actions.

If the dS lesion spared the rats' ability to modulate their running speed, the most parsimonious explanation of our results is that lesioned animals "preferred" slower speeds.
A similar conclusion had been reached when studying the origin of bradykinesia in PD, which led to the proposal that such reluctance to perform fast movements was caused by an increased sensitivity to movement cost (or effort) \cite{Mazzoni2007JN, Baraduc2013JN}.
Could a similar interpretation apply to our results?
To address this question, we took advantage of the optimal control framework that relies on the assumption that animal behavior is optimal with respect to a cost function.
We implemented a simple model to simulate the optimal trajectory of a rat taking into account costs related to locomotion control (effort) and those imposed by the task rules (running in the front is costly as this leads to premature ET, which is penalized).
Two approximations of effort- and task rules-related costs were combined in 4 versions of the models and we found that increasing effort sensitivity consistently resulted in optimal trajectories that were closer to the reward area, hence the combination of late initiation of the run phase with fast speeds not used (Fig. 4A).
This result is not only in agreement with the reduced running speed observed following lesion but is also reminiscent of the behavior observed during the very first post-lesion sessions, when animals with large dS lesion ran mainly close to the reward area (Fig 1, F and G). 
We thus reanalyzed the effect of dS lesion on the trajectory, focusing on animals with a significant reduction in running speed (Fig. 4B, i.e., animals with larger lesion) and on trials during which animals perfectly executed the wait-and-run routine.
Following dS lesion, rats started running forward earlier relative the length of the treadmill (Fig. 4C).
This effect, while being maximal on the first post-lesion sessions, remained significant after three weeks of daily testing (Fig. 4D) and was correlated with lesion size (Fig. 4E).
