Past few years have been quite a journey.
I have learned how to do science and I have met amazing people in the process.
First, I want to thank David for none of this would have been possible without him.
He thought me how to think like a scientist and afforded me the space to act like one.
Second, I must express my absolute gratitude for the incredible group of labmates with whom I had the chance to work.
In particular, Maria-Teresa is a wonderful human, I learned from her more than I can reckon and I am forever in her debt.
Special thanks should also be extended to Jordane.
He meticulously carried out the experiments and assisted in many aspects of this project.
Corane as well greatly helped with final steps of the experiments.
I am exteremely grateful for her efforts.
Furthermore, I sincerely appreciate Anna Montagnini, Ingrid Beareu, Jerome Epzstein, and Julie Koening for their constructive comments and invaluable input throughout this project and my thesis work.

I also had the pleasure to get to know many collegues at Inmed who became my friends, were there for me and made my time in Marseille as memorable as it was.
Thanks to Sanaz, for her countless tips that helped me settle here and for her friendship to this date.
To Anass, for numerous coffee breaks during which we discussed literally, everything!
To Ludovic and Stefania, my thoughtful officemates, who helped me a great deal in different stages.
And to all my friends, Carla, Romain, Davide, Simona, and Alla whose company I cherished everyday.
