Past few years have been quite a journey.
I have learned how to do science and I have met amazing people in the process.
First, I want to thank David, for none of this would have been possible without him.
He thought me how to think like a scientist and afforded me the space to act like one.
Second, I must express my absolute gratitude for the incredible group of labmates with whom I had the chance to work.
Maria-Teresa is a wonderful human, I learned from her more than I can reckon.
