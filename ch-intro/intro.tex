\chapter{Introduction}
\label{ch:intro:intro}
For humans and other animals, in any given context, an adaptive behavior is defined as the capacity to execute the action that will maximize immediate or future rewards, while minimizing energetic expenditure.
For example, consider any solitary hunter that would wait for the right time to attack: 
    when the prey is most distracted or vulnerable.
However, in some situations, the appearance of a sensory cue will not only indicate which action should be performed, but also how long, after appearance of the cue, this action must be initiated~\cite{Balsam2009Map, Nobre2018NatRevNeurosci}.
For instance, athletes performing sprint races learn by experience that the \textit{go} command, signalling them to start running, will be given in two seconds after the \textit{set} command.
False starts, i.e., beginning to run too early, demonstrates athletes' accurate estimation of the 2 second interval between the \textit{set} and \textit{go} commands.
More generally, the ability of animals to exploit temporal regularities in nature is crucial for survival:
    The appearance of a sensory cue at a given time can predict food availability, predator attack, or mating opportunity~\cite{Kacelnik2002,Gallistel1990book}.

In this chapter, first I discuss two possible mechanisms that could give rise to the perception of elapsed time.
Then, I will present some evidence of how these mechanisms are implemented, in particular,  the role of a certain brain structure that is implicated by both of the above mechanisms, however, in different ways.
Finally, I will lay out the question and the hypothesis underlying this work and the structure of the following chapters.
