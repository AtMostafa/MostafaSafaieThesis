\chapter{Methods} 
\label{ch:methods:methods}
Time perception is convoluted with motor functions.
As discussed in the \hyperref[ch:intro:intro]{first chapter}, disentangling the two has proven to be difficult, and often, overlooked.
Therefore, interpretations might have been biased toward disregarding the actual behavioral algorithms, in favor of the neuronal correlations.
Here, using a novel behavioral paradigm allowed studying the motor activity of the animals --and the function of the \gls{ds}-- as well as their timing performance.
In this chapter, I will discuss the behavioral task in detail, along with all the experimental and analytical methods used in this project.
