\chapter{Methods} 
\label{ch:methods:methods}
Time perception is convoluted with motor functions.
As discussed in the \hyperref[ch:intro:intro]{first chapter}, disentangling the two has proven to be difficult, and sometimes, overlooked.
Using original behavioral tasks, designed with the above concern in mind, might shed new light on this matter.
In this chapter, I present a novel behavioral paradigm that allowed monitoring the locomotive activity of the animals as well as their timing performance.
I also provide technical details about different variants of this paradigm used in this work.
I also present all the experimental and analytical methods used in this project.
