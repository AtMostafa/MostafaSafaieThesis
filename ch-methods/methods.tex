\chapter{Methods} 
\label{ch:methods:methods}
Time perception is convoluted with motor functions.
As discussed in the \hyperref[ch:intro:intro]{first chapter}, disentangling the two has proven to be difficult, and sometimes, overlooked.
Using original behavioral tasks, designed with the above concern in mind, might shed new light on this matter.
In this chapter, I present a novel behavioral paradigm that allowed monitoring the locomotive activity of the animals as well as their timing performance.
I will discuss the behavioral task in detail, along with all the experimental and analytical methods used in this project.
