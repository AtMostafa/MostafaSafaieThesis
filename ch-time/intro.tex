\chapter{Embodied Timing} \label{ch:time}

To investigate how animals adapt their behavior to temporal regularities in their environment, we challenged Long-Evans rats in a treadmill-based behavioral assay that required them to wait for 7~s before approaching a ``reward area''.\footnotemark

The treadmill belt was surrounded by long walls.
The front wall was equipped with a device delivering rewards (a drop of sucrose solution) and an infrared beam, located 10~cm from this device, which defined the limit of the reward area (see \Autoref{fig:methods:taskRules}{a}).
Animals were first familiarized with the apparatus and were trained to lick drops of the sucrose solution delivered every minute while the treadmill was immobile (see \autoref{ch:methods:habituation} for more details).
Then, rats were trained once a day (Mondays to Fridays) for 55~minutes in the proper treadmill waiting task.
Each daily session contained $\sim$130 trials interleaved with resting periods of 15~s (intertrials, while motor was off).
Each trial started by turning the treadmill motor on at a fixed speed of 10~cm/s.
The conveyor belt moved toward the rear of the treadmill (\Autoref{fig:methods:taskRules}{a}).
The \gls{et} of the animals in the reward area (detected by the first interruption of the infrared beam in each trial) relative to a \emph{\gls{gt}} (7~s after motor onset) defined 3~types of trials:
    Trials in which animals entered the reward area after the \gls{gt} were classified as correct ($7\leq ET<15$, \Autoref{fig:methods:taskRules}{b});
    Trials in which animals entered the reward area before the \gls{gt} were classified as error ($1.5\leq ET<7$, \Autoref{fig:methods:taskRules}{c});
    Finally, if in 15~s an animal failed to interrupt the infrared beam, the trial ended and was classified as omission (\Autoref{fig:methods:taskRules}{d}).
Interruptions that occurred during the first 1.5~s ($ET<1.5$) were ignored (in other words, the infrared beam was not active during the first 1.5~s of trials) to allow the animals to leave (either passively or actively) the reward area at the beginning of each trial.
Moreover, the exact value of the \gls{et} determined the reward/punishment ratio (see \autoref{ch:methods:reward}).
A punishment period of extra running started when the animals erroneously crossed the infrared beam before the \gls{gt} ($1.5\leq ET<7$).
The punishment duration varied between 10~s and 1~s, according to the error magnitude (\Autoref{fig:methods:taskRules}{c, inset}).
In addition, to progressively encourage the animals to enter the reward area just after the \gls{gt}, the smallest \gls{et} value that triggered reward delivery was raised across sessions, according to each animal's performance, until it reached the \gls{gt} (\Autoref{fig:methods:taskRules}{b, inset} and see \autoref{ch:methods:reward} for details).
Thus, to maximize reward collection and minimize running time, animals should approach the reward just after the \gls{gt}.
