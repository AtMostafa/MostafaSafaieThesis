    {\textbf{Decreased temporal accuracy when the goal time is shortened.}
    \textbf{a)}
    Median entrance time ($ET$) during training.
    The dashed magenta line shows the goal time ($GT=3.5$~s).
    The right y-axis shows standard deviation~($SD$) of $ET$.
    \textbf{b)}
    Median trajectory of ``short~GT'' animals after training.
    Colored lines indicate performance of individual animals.
    Dashed line's slope shows the treadmill speed (i.e., 10~cm/s).
    \textbf{c)}
    PDF of the maximum position reached by the short~GT animals before approaching the reward area for correct (green) and incorrect (red) trials.
    Dashed lines represent cumulative distribution functions (right y-axis).
    Data collected from session~\#~$\geq15$.
    \textbf{d)} 
    Sharp reward condition applied to short~GT and control experiments.
    \textit{Top}: reward profiles in the sharp reward condition applied to the short~GT experiments (dark) and the control experiments (light).
    \textit{Bottom}: trajectories of 2 illustrative sessions after extensive training in sharp condition (\textit{left}, short~GT; \textit{right}, control).
    Highlighted areas indicate the reward window.
    \textbf{e)}
    Coefficient of variation~($CV$) for short~GT and control experiments with normal (the first two boxes), and sharp (the last two boxes) reward profiles.
    Data collected and averaged once performance plateaued (after session~\#15 for short~GT, sessions~\#20 to~\#30 for control, and the last 5 sessions for the sharp condition experiments).
    short~GT vs. Control: $p<0.0001$ (permutation test, see \autoref{ch:methods:tech});
    Sharp short~GT vs. Sharp control: $p<0.0001$ (permutation test);
    short~GT vs. Sharp short~GT: Non significant (non-parametric paired comparison); 
    Control vs. Sharp control: $p=0.79$ (permutation test).
    \textbf{f)}
    Similar to panel~a, for another group of animals that were trained to wait for 3.5~s while the speed of the treadmill was 20~cm/s.
    \textbf{g)}
    Similar to panel~b, for animals trained in short goal time at~20~cm/s condition (panel~f).
    Dashed line's slope shows the treadmill speed (i.e., 20~cm/s).
    Dotted line's slope indicates control treadmill speed (i.e., 10~cm/s).
    \textbf{h)}
    $CV$ for short~GT and short~GT at 20~cm/s conditions (same colors as in panels~b,~g).
    Data collected and averaged once performance plateaued (after session~\#15).
    short~GT vs. short~GT 20~cm/s: Asterisk indicates significant difference (10,000 resamples with replacement, see \nameref{ch:methods:methods}).
