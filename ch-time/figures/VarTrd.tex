    {\textbf{Decreased temporal accuracy when the treadmill speed changes across trials.}
    \textbf{a)}
    For each trial, treadmill speed was either fixed at 10~cm/s (control condition, same data as in \autoref{fig-ctrlTrd}), or randomly selected from a uniform distribution between 5 and 30~cm/s (variable speed condition).
    \textbf{b)}
    Median $ET$ for animals trained in the variable speed (black), and control (gray) conditions.
    Colored dots indicate individual performance for "variable speed" animals.
    Yellow line shows statistically significant differences between groups (permutation test, see \nameref{methods}).
    \textbf{c)}
    Median trajectory of "variable speed" animals in session \#30 (same colors as in panel~b).
    \textbf{d)}
    Probability of correct ($7\leq~ET<15~s$) and precise ($6<ET<8~s$) trial, given the treadmill speed, for "variable speed" animals (session~\# $\geq$20).
    \textbf{e)}
    After extensive training in control condition, animals ($n=14$) were tested in a probe session with variable speed.
    \textbf{f)}
    Median $ET$s (\textit{left}), $SD$ of $ET$s (\textit{middle}) and percentage of correct trials (\textit{right}) in the sessions immediately before and after the change in speed condition.
    Each line represents a single animal.
    Asterisks indicate significant differences (non-parametric paired comparison, see \nameref{methods}).
    \textbf{g)}
    Similar to panel~d, for the data collected from the probe session.
