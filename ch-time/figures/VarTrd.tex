    {\textbf{Decreased temporal accuracy when the treadmill speed randomly changed every trial.}
    \textbf{a)}
    For each trial, treadmill speed was either fixed at 10~cm/s (control condition, same data as in \autoref{fig:time:CtrlTrd}), or randomly selected from a uniform distribution between 5 and 30~cm/s (variable speed condition).
    \textbf{b)}
    Median \gls{et} for animals trained in the variable speed (black), and control (gray) conditions.
    Colored dots indicate individual ``variable speed'' animals.
    Golden line in this manuscript shows statistically significant differences between groups (permutation test).
    \textbf{c)}
    Median trajectory of variable speed animals in session \#30 (same colors as in panel~b).
    \textbf{d)}
    Probability of correct (7~$\leq$~ET~$<$~15~s) and precise (6~$<$~ET~$<$~8~s) trials, given the treadmill speed, for variable speed animals (session~\# $\geq$20).
    \textbf{e)}
    After extensive training in the control condition, some animals ($n=14$) were tested in a probe session with variable speed.
    \textbf{f)}
    Median \gls{et} (\textit{left}), $SD$ of ET (\textit{middle}), and percentage of correct trials (\textit{right}) in the sessions before and after the change in the speed condition.
    Each line represents a single animal.
    Asterisks indicate significant differences (non-parametric paired comparison).
    \textbf{g)}
    Similar to panel~d, for the data collected from the probe session.
